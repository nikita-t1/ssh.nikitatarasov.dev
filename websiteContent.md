## Background

Hi!

I'm a Software Developer and Electronics Technician based in Germany

During the final year of my training as an Electronics Technician for Devices and Systems,
I was introduced to modern software development.
I created a "Cocktail Machine" using Java on a Raspberry Pi 4, controlling pumps via GPIO pins,
guided by an experienced developer who offered insights and best practices.

After completing my training, I started working as a Test Field Technician.
However, a portion of my time I contributed to improving and further developing the company's internal error database.
This project involved a JavaEE server, a Spring MVC web interface, and a JavaFX Client.

After switching to a different company, I didn't have the opportunity to work on any software projects
so I decided to start learning on my own. During free time, I started learning web development.
I started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and later I moved on to Vue.js.
I also started learning Kotlin for Backend and Android development and Python for small scripts.

## About Me

Alongside my development work, I also have a solid foundation in electronics and hardware.
I love tinkering with electronics and building small projects using microcontrollers like the Arduino and microcomputers like the Raspberry Pi.

I also enjoy watching movies and TV shows in my free time.
My favorite genres are science fiction and superhero movies. You can follow my watch progress on [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/users/nikita-t1).

Also I'm really into reading books.
I mostly read non-fiction books about social sciences, psychology, and politics, but occasionally I also read some science fiction or even romance novels.
